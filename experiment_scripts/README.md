This folder contains simple .py files which were used to generate all of the validation MSE loss data. 
These scripts cannot plot verification examples or generate a new dataset, they load in a pre-generated dataset, stored as a .csv file.

As the original .csv files used to train all of the models and generate the validation MSE loss data are too large to upload, one can generate new files using the `training_csv_gen.py` script. Ensure to change the output file name in the last line, for each new dataset.
